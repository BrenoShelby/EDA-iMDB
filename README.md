# Exploratory Data Analysis - IMDb
Everybody who knows me know I like movies as much programming. Then, I've been decided to make this notebook with the purpose of practicing my programming skills on R language, actually, I've still studying it. And, to show some insights about movies, for example, do you know about the nerd supremacy in cinema? Nerdy movies have always dominated the cinema and I can proof (~~hehe~~).

I choose a [IMDb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset) and selected some questions I wanted to answer. Follow below:

- How much is the volume of movies over the years?
- Which are the countries most predominant in cinema over the years?
- Which are the genres most predominant in cinema over the years?
- Which are the highest box offices in the last years? And which are your genres?
- There is some correlation in highest box office with IMDb score?
- The more awards the film has, the higher it's box office?
- Which are the genres with most awards over the years?

# What's IMDb?
IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.
